# User Interface
<p align="justify">
 
 The interface has changed a lot from the last version. With this new app, everything takes a minimalist touch, letting the user focus on the SVG. Furthermore, the app gets a look more profesional and the new features like the rotation with the mouse or the movement for the terminal gives to the user a better experience. 
 The app has some new buttons for the new features. These are them and their description.
</p>

 ## Night Mode

 <p>
    A new mode has been added to the app, now you can get a dark mode like GitHub or Chrome. Press the button to set your favourite mode.
 </p>

 ## SVG Buttons

 <p>
    New buttons that allow you to save the code from the terminal, save the SVG or import your code to the web
 </p>

 ## Dock buttons

 <p>
    Two new buttons to reallocate the terminal through the window. You can get this new positions putting closer the terminal to the bottom or right of the window. Try it yourself!
 </p>

 ## Rotation Settings

 <p>
    Now that the rotation is possible with the right click, you can personalize the velocity. It depends on your browser which is the perfect velocity. The default velocity is prepared for Safari, try to reduce it a little bit if you use Chrome or Mozilla.
